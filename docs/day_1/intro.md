# General overview and scientific presentations

*Saturday 11 March 2023*

```{admonition} General introduction

The first day of the workshop is meant to help shape the rest of the week. Based on the scientific presentations and inputs from the participants, we hope to gather ideas and suggestions about the most pressing questions we can address with OGGM (and other open-source data products / models) in Pakistan.
