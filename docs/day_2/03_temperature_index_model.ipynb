    "Note that a full mass balance model should take into account both accumulation (snowfall) and ablation (melt). Furthermore, distributed models like OGGM need to simulate the mass-balance at different elevations, which requires other paramters (such as lapse rate). Fundamentally, however, the equations is very simple. If you are interested, [here](https://github.com/OGGM/oggm/blob/ade87f6b5b7f3115800023a57f12b9da59c90d69/oggm/core/massbalance.py#L647) is the code of the equation in OGGM. \"Easy\", right?\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperature index models can be extended to include more processes, such as radiation or snow aging. OGGM PhD student Lilian, for example, wrote a model which takes into account the influence of aging of the snow on the melt factor. For this, you'll need to implement a kind of \"snowpack\" model, where snow height is tracked over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are finished early and want to go further, have a look at [this OGGM tutorial](https://oggm.org/tutorials/stable/notebooks/beginner/plot_mass_balance.html) on plotting the mass balance. In two days, we will go deeper into the implementation and calibration of the models in OGGM."
